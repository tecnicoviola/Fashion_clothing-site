There is a Lack Of Senior Citizensâ€™ Engagement On Online Fashion Platforms and section which contains fashion of other states .

1.Online fashion platforms often spotlight trends that primarily cater to younger demographics such as children and those aged 20-45. These trends frequently lack regional specificity, which can alienate older consumers who have distinct preferences.

2.  The presentation of clothing on young models further complicates matters. Older adults may  struggle to envision how these styles would translate to their own needs and preferences, as the representation does not align with their demographic.

3.   The abundance of information available online can overwhelm older users. Without adequate guidance tailored to their specific needs, navigating through fashion choices and making informed decisions becomes daunting.

	These factors underscore the barriers that affluent older adults face when engaging with online shopping platforms, particularly within the dynamic and trend-driven fashion industry. Bridging these gaps is essential to ensure inclusivity and accessibility in the digital marketplace, aligning with the broader goal of making the Internet a truly universal resource for all demographics.
